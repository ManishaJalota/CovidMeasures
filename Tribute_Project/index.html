				<h3 class="headers">How can we describe COVID-19?</h3>
				COVID-19 had impacted people to a great extent.
				The lives of people have changed a lot. This has taken its toll on people around the world. Starting from one part of the world and spreading across the whole globe made it a monsterous pandemic. It spreaded like a fire in Australian forests. 
				2020 was not an easy year for the world.But, we are in this all together . It had created differences in people. People are afraid of each other. Wearing masks, sanitizing hands and keeping a 2 meter distance has become the daily normal.
				<br/>
				Most of the people died, people sufffered,people are impacted directly or indirectly with the covid effects.
				<BR/><BR/>
				Many people lost their jobs, people got unemployed. I also suffered and COVID impacted me in a way that I got unemployed, but this is what we got to do.

<h3 class="headers">COVID-19 in TORONTO</h3>
<p>Toronto, beautiful city of sky-scrapper carrying CN tower in its heart is also affected by COVID-19 and it demise can be heard and seen all across Canada. We are in phase-2 of COVID-19 and now all the dine-ins are closed, the cases are increasing rapidly.
I miss going out, I miss sitting in a cafe fearlessly sipping from a cup of coffee looking outside the window and seeing people seing cars running.

<h3 class="headers"> Special Thanks</h3>
<p>Special Thanks to all the front-line workers who are working every day even during this covid to make our lives safe and better. Be it a doctor or nurse, or be it an uber driver or a bus driver, everyone is risking their life only to make the world a better place.
